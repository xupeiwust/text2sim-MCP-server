## JSON Schemas

Text2Sim MCP Server uses formal JSON Schema validation (Draft 2020-12) to ensure simulation model correctness and provide structured error reporting. The server supports two distinct JSON formats optimized for their respective simulation paradigms.

### Discrete-Event Simulation JSON Format

The server uses a SimPy-compatible JSON schema for Discrete-Event Simulation models. This format provides declarative configuration that maps directly to SimPy's native capabilities.

#### Basic Structure

```json
{
  "run_time": 480,
  "entity_types": {
    "customer": {
      "probability": 1.0,
      "value": {"min": 10, "max": 50},
      "priority": 5
    }
  },
  "resources": {
    "server": {
      "capacity": 2,
      "resource_type": "fifo"
    }
  },
  "processing_rules": {
    "steps": ["server"],
    "server": {
      "distribution": "uniform(5, 10)"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Key Components

- **Entity Types**: Define different classes of entities with probabilities, values, priorities, and custom attributes
- **Resources**: Specify system resources with capacity limits and queuing disciplines (FIFO, priority, preemptive)
- **Processing Rules**: Configure sequential processing steps with service time distributions and conditional routing
- **Behavioral Rules**: Support for balking, reneging, resource failures, and complex routing logic

#### Resource Types

- **FIFO**: First-in-first-out queuing (SimPy Resource)
- **Priority**: Priority-based queuing (SimPy PriorityResource)
- **Preemptive**: Preemptive priority queuing (SimPy PreemptiveResource)

For detailed documentation of the DES JSON format, see `schemas/DES/README.md`.

### System Dynamics JSON Format

The server uses a PySD-compatible JSON schema for System Dynamics simulations. This format provides direct compatibility with the PySD Python library ecosystem.

#### Basic Structure

```json
{
  "abstractModel": {
    "originalPath": "model_name.json",
    "sections": [{
      "name": "__main__",
      "type": "main",
      "elements": [
        {
          "name": "Stock_Name",
          "components": [{
            "type": "Stock",
            "ast": {
              "syntaxType": "IntegStructure",
              "flow": {"syntaxType": "ReferenceStructure", "reference": "Flow_Name"},
              "initial": {"syntaxType": "ReferenceStructure", "reference": "1000"}
            }
          }],
          "units": "items"
        }
      ]
    }]
  }
}
```

#### Component Types

- **Stock**: Accumulation variables that integrate flows over time
- **Flow**: Rate variables that change stock values
- **Auxiliary**: Calculated variables derived from other variables

#### Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Structures

The PySD format supports two approaches for mathematical expressions:

- **Simple References**: String-based expressions (e.g., `"Birth_Rate - Death_Rate"`)
- **Arithmetic Structures**: Explicit mathematical structures with defined operators and arguments

For detailed documentation of the PySD JSON format, see `docs/PYSD_JSON_SCHEMA_INTEGRATION.md`, `docs/PYSD_AST_STRUCTURES_GUIDE.md`, and `schemas/SD/README.md`.

## Architecture

Text2Sim is structured into modular components:

- **MCP Server** – Handles natural language requests via MCP.
- **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) Module**
  - **Simulation Model** – Core [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) engine that executes process flows.
  - **Entity Class** – Represents units flowing through the system.
  - **Process Steps** – Encapsulate logic for each process stage.
  - **Metrics Collector** – Gathers statistics like wait times and throughput.
  - **Secure Distribution Parser** – Parses probability distributions safely.
- **System Dynamics (SD) Module**
  - **PySD Integration** – Executes models using PySD-compatible abstractModel JSON format.
  - **Schema Validation** – Validates models against abstract_model_v2.json schema.
  - **Single-Schema Architecture** – Direct [PySD](https://pysd.readthedocs.io/en/master/) workflow compatibility without format conversion.

### Documentation

Additional technical documentation is available:

- `docs/PYSD_JSON_SCHEMA_INTEGRATION.md` - PySD JSON format specification
- `docs/PYSD_AST_STRUCTURES_GUIDE.md` - AST structure patterns and best practices
- `schemas/SD/README.md` - System Dynamics schema documentation
- `schemas/DES/README.md` - Discrete-Event Simulation schema files
- `SINGLE_SCHEMA_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture overview and design decisions

---

## Security Considerations

- **No `eval()` usage**  
  Regex-based parsing prevents arbitrary code execution.
  
- **Input Validation**  
  Distribution types, parameters, and model configurations are validated before execution.

- **Robust Error Handling**  
  Errors are reported cleanly without leaking internal state.

## Disclaimer

**Text2Sim MCP Server** is a project under active development. While we strive for accuracy and stability, please be aware of the following:

- **Work in Progress:** The software is continuously evolving. Features may change, and you may encounter bugs or incomplete functionality. We welcome bug reports and contributions to help us improve!
- **LLM-Powered Tool:** This server is designed to be used with Large Language Models (LLMs). The quality of the simulation models and the accuracy of the results depend heavily on the LLM's capabilities.
- **Verify Your Results:** Always critically review and validate any simulation models and their outputs. The results should be used as a guide and not as a substitute for professional validation.

We are excited for you to use Text2Sim and hope you find it valuable. Your feedback is crucial to its development.
