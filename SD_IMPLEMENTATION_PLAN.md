## Executive Summary

The System Dynamics (SD) implementation in Text2Sim MCP Server has excellent architectural foundations but is currently non-functional due to missing core components. This plan outlines a systematic approach to restore functionality and enhance the SD modeling capabilities.

**Current Status:** 3/10 - Good foundation, missing core functionality
**Target Status:** 9/10 - Production-ready SD modeling platform
**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for core functionality, 6-8 weeks for full enhancement

## Phase 1: Critical Recovery (Week 1)
*Priority: BLOCKING - Make SD functional*

### 1.1 Dependency Installation
**Objective:** Install required PySD dependencies

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install PySD library via uv
- [ ] Update pyproject.toml with SD dependencies
- [ ] Verify PySD installation and compatibility
- [ ] Test basic PySD JSON loading capabilities

**Dependencies to Install:**
```toml
pysd = "^3.14.0"
xarray = "^2024.6.0"  # PySD dependency for data handling
pandas = "^2.0.0"     # Required for PySD data manipulation
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- PySD imports successfully in Python environment
- Basic PySD model creation works
- No dependency conflicts with existing packages

### 1.2 Core Integration Module Creation
**Objective:** Create the missing `SD/sd_integration.py` module

**File:** `/SD/sd_integration.py`

**Required Classes:**
```python
class PySDJSONIntegration:
    def __init__(self)
    def validate_json_model(self, model: dict) -> ValidationResult
    def simulate_json_model(self, model: dict, **kwargs) -> SimulationResult
    def convert_vensim_to_json(self, vensim_path: str) -> dict
    def get_model_info(self, model: dict) -> ModelInfo
```

**Key Methods Implementation:**
- JSON to PySD Abstract Model conversion
- Model validation against PySD requirements
- Simulation execution with parameter overrides
- Error handling and meaningful error messages

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All MCP SD tools import successfully
- Basic model validation works
- Simple simulation execution completes
- Proper error handling for invalid models

### 1.3 Template Structure Fixes
**Objective:** Fix PySD compatibility violations in all SD templates

**Files to Fix:**
- `/templates/SD/population_growth.json`
- `/templates/SD/sir_epidemiology.json`
- `/templates/SD/economic_growth.json`
- `/templates/SD/inventory_management.json`

**Required Changes:**
1. **Add explicit component names:** Each component must have a `name` field matching the element name
2. **Verify one-component-per-element:** Ensure no elements contain multiple components
3. **Validate AST structures:** Confirm all syntax types are correctly implemented
4. **Test with PySD:** Verify templates load successfully in PySD

**Example Fix:**
```json
// BEFORE (Incorrect)
{
  "name": "population",
  "components": [{
    "type": "Stock",
    "subtype": "Normal",
    // Missing name field
  }]
}

// AFTER (Correct)
{
  "name": "population",
  "components": [{
    "name": "population",  // Explicit component name
    "type": "Stock",
    "subtype": "Normal",
  }]
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All templates validate against PySD requirements
- Templates load successfully in PySD without errors
- Mathematical relationships are preserved
- Metadata and examples remain intact

4. **Documentation-First:** Update docs as features are implemented

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Reviews:** All changes reviewed before merge
- **Automated Testing:** CI/CD pipeline includes SD model tests
- **User Testing:** Validate with real SD modeling scenarios
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track validation and simulation performance

### Risk Mitigation
- **Dependency Management:** Pin PySD version to avoid breaking changes
